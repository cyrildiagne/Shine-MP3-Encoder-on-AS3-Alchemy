 * Warranty Information
 * Even though Apple has reviewed this software, Apple makes no warranty
 * or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this
 * software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a 
 * particular purpose.  As a result, this software is provided "as is,"

 *
 * This code may be used and freely distributed as long as it includes
 * this copyright notice and the warranty information.
 *
 * Machine-independent I/O routines for IEEE floating-point numbers.
 *
 * NaN's and infinities are converted to HUGE_VAL or HUGE, which
 * happens to be infinity on IEEE machines.  Unfortunately, it is
 * impossible to preserve NaN's in a machine-independent way.
 * Infinities are, however, preserved on IEEE machines.
 *
 * These routines have been tested on the following machines:
 *	Apple Macintosh, MPW 3.1 C compiler
 *	Apple Macintosh, THINK C compiler
 *	Silicon Graphics IRIS, MIPS compiler
 *	Cray X/MP and Y/MP
 *	Digital Equipment VAX
 *	Sequent Balance (Multiprocesor 386)
 *	NeXT
 *
 *
 * Implemented by Malcolm Slaney and Ken Turkowski.
 *
 * Malcolm Slaney contributions during 1988-1990 include big- and little-
 * endian file I/O, conversion to and from Motorola's extended 80-bit
 * floating-point format, and conversions to and from IEEE single-
 * precision floating-point format.
 *
 * In 1991, Ken Turkowski implemented the conversions to and from
 * IEEE double-precision format, added more precision to the extended
 * conversions, and accommodated conversions involving +/- infinity,
 * NaN's, and denormalized numbers.
